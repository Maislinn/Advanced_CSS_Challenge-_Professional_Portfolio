## Short Decription: 
- USER STORY: AS A UC Berkeley Student I WANT a codebase that shows a sample portfolio of work SO THAT recruiters and students alike can learn about me. (This is a work in progress)

- ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: 
-GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
-WHEN I load their portfolio
-THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
-WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
-THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
-WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
-THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
-WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
-THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
-WHEN I click on the images of the applications
-THEN I am taken to that deployed application
-WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
-THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

- What did you learn?
   - I continue to learn more front en languages to demonstarte my projects and display them on a webpage. I have learned a lot about CSS and specifically scrolling

## Installation

- This is a webpage and requires no installations for the user to view. To create I used HTML & CSS. 

## Usage

- This website can be used to highlight the work I complete while a student at UC Berkeley. You can visit my orginal website at www.maislinnhelfer.com to view my previous work

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
